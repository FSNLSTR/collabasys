To setup venv = source env/bin/activate
To run project = python manage.py runserver

Run both sequentially to make migrations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate


Postgres Setup:
1) Install postgres 14 via postgres app installation (https://postgresapp.com/)
2) For this project optional step 3 is NOT optional, run 
sudo mkdir -p /etc/paths.d && echo /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin | sudo tee /etc/paths.d/postgresapp
to set up CLI tools
3) In the commited version of settings.py username yashgollapudi is used, replace that with local username
4) create a server names collabasys for the tables to be hosted on
5) run migrations above and you will be all set up

Notes:
1) Step 3 will be changed when we move to a cloud provider, this is only for the time being during setup and testing
2) You will lose all users you have created when using the sqllite 3 database, so create a new super user and whatever else you want, 
optionally you can export your data but this is more complicated so I recommend against it.
